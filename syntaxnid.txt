like std::cout as printing to conasole. <ight call it std:qout becuase why not

OH MY GOSH IM COOKING make using namespace std; error becuase that is stupid
force nullptr ccheclig, and also use malloc free instead of new delete
muyst return from main function
allow both using free delete malloc and new
must use this in class inits
error codes go area specific code. area is two and code is 2. Area is broad, code is per erro code. code 0000= sucess, 01 = syntax erro, 0101 = token parsing error(unexpected char)
